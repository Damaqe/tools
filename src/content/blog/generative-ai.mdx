## Potential threat

The threat is simple: [generative AI] has the potential to reduce the demand for
technical writers because it's getting pretty good at our job.

Take [ChatGPT] for example. You ask it questions in a familiar chat UI and it
responds with answers that have been synthesized from a variety of sources.
A lot of these answers are actually relevant and helpful. It can respond in
text, [code], and [image].

If it's any consolation, the generative AI community does not have a vendetta
against technical writers in particular. It is potentially a [general purpose
technology that may affect most jobs].

## Potential productivity boon

Long story short, I can imagine a future where generative AI does not replace
technical writers but is instead just a powerful new tool that increases our
productivity. There are lots of possibilities in this regard, but I will focus
on only one for now.

Take the age-old "never enough time to document everything" problem for example.
Once I become proficient in the technical domain I'm documenting, I often
realize how little of that domain I will ever be able to document. There simply
is never enough time to cover everything. Generative AI has the potentially to
dramatically speed up the research and content creation process, so it has the
potential to help me finally make progress on the "never enough time" problem.
Generative AI doesn't really seem like a threat to me in this context for a few
reasons:

* It's work that I never previously had time to get to anyways.
* It may still be more efficient to have a technical writer in the mix than
  to try to automate everything completely. After all, as xkcd so brilliantly
  summarized in [Automation], the funny thing about automation is that you do
  it because you think it will save you time when in reality it's often the
  opposite.
* You may still need someone who is proficient in technical writing and
  the technical domain in order to effectively orchestrate the generative AI.

## The jury is still out

I caution against taking either side at this point. It's simply too soon to
know yet.
