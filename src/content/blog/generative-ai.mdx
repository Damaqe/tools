## Threat

The threat is simple: [generative AI] has the potential to reduce the demand for
technical writers because it's getting pretty good at our job.

Let's take [ChatGPT] for example. You ask it questions in a familiar chat UI, it
analyzes the language of your question, it searches across a huge data set for
similar language that appears related to your question, and then it synthesizes
all of that data into a response. A lot of these responses are actually relevant
and helpful. It can respond in text, [code], and [image].

If it's any consolation, the generative AI community does not have a vendetta
against technical writers in particular. It is potentially a [general purpose
technology that may affect most jobs].

## Promise

Long story short, I can imagine a future where generative AI does not replace
technical writers but is instead just a powerful new tool that increases our
productivity. There are lots of possibilities in this regard, but I will focus
on only one for now.

Let's take the age-old "never enough time to document everything" paradox of
technical writing for example. Once you become proficient in the technical
domain you're documenting, you often realize how little of that domain you will
ever be able to document. There simply is never enough time to cover everything.
I have a very vivid example of this from my days on [Lighthouse] but I will have
to save that for a later post. For now, suffice it to say that it seems like
generative AI might have helped me document much more of that domain. It doesn't
really seem like a threat because it was work that I previously never would have
had time to get to. Also it doesn't seem like a threat because it probably be
most efficient to have a technical writer in the mix who is orchestrating,
evaluating, and gluing together all of the generative AI output. As xkcd so
brilliantly summarized in [Automation], even before we had generative AI it was
possible to automate most things. The funny thing is that it's usually more
productive to do some things manually.

## The jury is still out

I caution against taking either side at this point. It's simply too soon to
know yet.
